<h2>Good Luck answering the question</h2>

    <h1>Personal Game</h1>

  <p>I was born here in seattle WA. After a year my parents decided to move to Iowa, but after another year we moved back to Washington.
    I do not remember my time there, I was too young to remember. All I can recall are things that have happened as told from my parents.
    Throughout my life I went to a private school in West Seattle. This place has special moments to my family.
    We have gone to church there for years, my parents met there in a youth group, and they exchanged their vows there.
    I started when I was six in their pre-k and graduated when i was 14 in their 8th grade.
    After graduating from the schools elementary and middle school. I started a private school nearby.
    This is where I started to reconsider religion. No one wanted to answer any of my questions, so I stoped believing.
    I finshed the high school at eight-teen, but wish I graduated somewhere else. I feel that I have not left with anything that will help me in my future.</p>

    <p>Once high school was finished I started to work. My first job was at a Subway up north. I was a very long trip, especially since I lived south of seattle, and had to arrive at 5 in the morning.
      I applied but was not happy with the job. The location was scary, and the people were incredibly rude. Everyday started to become a drag, and I could not do my best.
      As time went on my best was not enough for people, so 'I could not' became 'I refused' to give my best.</p>

    <p>Near the end of the year, my family and I moved a bit closer to the high school I graduated from, for my sisters. During that time we had a chihuahua, who started having panick attacks.
      My mother and I took her to a vet nearby and I explained my thoughts on what, I believ, was happening to my dog. After diagnosing her and giving us relaxing pills, the doctor turned out to be the owner and offered me a job on spot.
      excited, I took the job, and quit working at Subway. </p>

    <p>Throughout my time working at a Veterinary hospital I had fun. There was some up and down moments, but it was a much better time than Subway. 
      While working, I also went to a community college near south Seattle. 
      School in the morning and work in the afternoon. Things so far were going smoothly.
      Unfortunately, this took a change for the worst. My boss started to call me earlier and earlier, to the point that I was missing all my classes.
      Along with working earlier, they also started to hold me back much later, so I would be too tired to do homework. I had to withdraw from my classes and had to stop going to school.
      I was devistated.
      I told myself if I was staying later I might as well start learning how to be a vet assistant,.
      So that's what I did, I started to prepare utensils for surgery, spin blood, doing x rays, and being a reseptionist.
      My spanish started to improve along with my social anxiety. Again, I thought things were going perfectly, until I was starting to be held back.
      The owner eventualy refused to let me to continue to learn. I wasn't allowed to do my job, yet I was all at the same time. And just like subway my best was becoming not good enough.
      So I quit. When I put in my two weeks they wanted to refuse me from leaving, I told them no. I told them they withheld me from contnuing my education, and if I wanted to learn, I wasn't allowed, or get scolded on why I haven't taught on specific things.</p>

    <p>Eventually, I started working at L.A. Fitness, not that long though, because four months later I started working at the airport. I like it, since I am still working there. They are allowing me to take time to do this course.</p>

    <p>
      My goal here is to start a career. I am currently trying to get my Mexican citizenship, so I can by land and have a retirement home for my family and I in Mexico, since the lasnd is so cheap there.
      Along side this goal, I also want to try and create video games, maybe not professionally but as a hobby, I love playing them, and think it would be fun to make them. </p>
